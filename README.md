## Summary
Harvey Mudd Colleges has 5 printers that connect to student printing, but often times one or more of the devices is out of order. Students have expressed frustration about not knowing whether or not the printer they are planning on using is functional, so this site aims to serve as an accurate and updated reflection of the status of Harvey Mudd's printers. This site aims to display info as well as take input about the printers on campus, so that whenever a student visits the printer, they can check its status beforehand, and update the status if anything has changed.

## MVP
Our MVP includes a webpage that displays a basic message about the each printer's status on campus, as well as the necessary forms so that somebody can change the printer status if necessary.
